# AI Coding Rules for Snowflake SQL Projects (Enhanced)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NO GUESSING POLICY

**If you are tempted to guess, STOP and verify against documentation instead.**

This rule is repeated throughout this document because it is the #1 cause of errors.

---

## ✅ ALWAYS DO THESE THINGS

### 1. **ALWAYS Read Documentation Word-for-Word**

When implementing ANY Snowflake feature:

1. **Open the official Snowflake documentation**
   - Don't rely on memory or patterns
   - Don't skim - READ every word of the syntax section

2. **Copy the exact syntax format**
   - Write it down
   - Verify parameter order
   - Check for required vs optional clauses

3. **Test with ONE example**
   - Verify one instance works correctly
   - Only then apply the pattern to others

4. **Common trap: Pattern matching**
   - ❌ BAD: "This looks similar to X, so it must work the same way"
   - ✅ GOOD: "Let me verify the exact syntax for this specific command"

#### Example: Semantic View Expressions

**Documentation says:** `table_alias.semantic_name AS sql_expression`

This means:
- **LEFT side**: Semantic name (how you reference it)
- **RIGHT side**: Actual column or SQL expression

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG (backwards - caused real errors in Early Warning project)
customers.city AS customer_city
fraud_alerts.alert_type AS fraud_alert_type

-- ✅ CORRECT (semantic name on LEFT, actual column on RIGHT)
customers.customer_city AS city
fraud_alerts.fraud_alert_type AS alert_type
```

**Lesson:** When semantic name matches column name, both work. When they differ, order matters. READ THE DOCS.

---

### 2. **ALWAYS Verify ALTER Command Capabilities**

Before using ALTER on any object, verify what it can actually do.

#### Example: ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW

**Documentation:** https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-semantic-view

ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW can ONLY:
1. RENAME TO - Rename the view
2. SET COMMENT - Modify comment
3. UNSET COMMENT - Remove comment

**That's it. Nothing else.**

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - ADD METRICS does not exist (caused real error in Early Warning project)
ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  ADD METRICS (
    table.metric AS expression
  );

-- ✅ CORRECT - Use CREATE OR REPLACE to modify anything else
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  TABLES (...)
  RELATIONSHIPS (...)
  DIMENSIONS (...)
  METRICS (
    -- All existing metrics
    -- Plus new metric
    table.new_metric AS expression
  )
  COMMENT = 'Description';
```

**Lesson:** Don't assume ALTER works the same across different object types. Verify each one.

---

### 3. **ALWAYS Check for SQL Reserved Words**

Reserved words like STATE, STATUS, COMMENT, etc. may need quoting in certain contexts.

```sql
-- ❌ May cause errors in semantic views
customers.state AS customer_state

-- ✅ Quote reserved words
customers."STATE" AS state
customers.customer_state AS "STATE"  -- or use in reverse (semantic name is safe)
```

**How to check:**
1. If you get "invalid identifier" errors
2. Check if the word is a SQL reserved word
3. Try quoting it with double quotes

---

### 4. **ALWAYS Verify Snowflake-Specific Syntax**

#### Array Indexing
- Snowflake arrays are **0-indexed**, not 1-indexed
- ❌ Wrong: `ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('a','b','c')[UNIFORM(1, 3, RANDOM())]`
- ✅ Correct: `ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('a','b','c')[UNIFORM(0, 2, RANDOM())]`

#### Function Arguments
- `UNIFORM()` requires **constant** arguments for min and max
- `GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => n)` requires a **constant** for ROWCOUNT
- ❌ Wrong: `UNIFORM(1, DATEDIFF('day', date1, date2), RANDOM())`
- ✅ Correct: `FLOOR(1 + RANDOM() * (DATEDIFF('day', date1, date2) - 1))`

#### Numeric Handling
- `RANDOM()` returns a **large integer**, not a float between 0 and 1
- Always use `ABS(RANDOM()) % range` for modulo operations
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT cast to target type before arithmetic operations
- ❌ Wrong: `(ABS(RANDOM()) % 10000)::NUMBER(5,2) / 100` (causes overflow)
- ✅ Correct: `(ABS(RANDOM()) % 10000) / 100.0` (arithmetic first, implicit cast to column type)

#### Column Alias References
- Cannot reference column alias in same SELECT where it's defined
- ❌ Wrong: `SELECT col1 AS x, x + 1 AS y`
- ✅ Correct: Use subquery or CTE to define aliases first, or repeat the expression

#### Correlated Subqueries
- Snowflake does not support correlated subqueries in SELECT list or certain JOIN contexts
- ✅ Use LEFT JOIN with QUALIFY instead

---

### 5. **ALWAYS Check NOT NULL Constraints and JOIN Logic**

When using LEFT JOIN to populate columns, verify the column isn't NOT NULL.

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG (caused real errors in Early Warning project)
INSERT INTO ACCOUNTS
SELECT
    customer_id,
    c.institution_id,  -- NULL from LEFT JOIN if customer not found
    ...
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 150000))
LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS c ON c.customer_id = <generated_value>;

-- ✅ CORRECT - Generate the value directly for NOT NULL columns
INSERT INTO ACCOUNTS
SELECT
    customer_id,
    'FI' || LPAD((ABS(RANDOM()) % 50) + 1, 5, '0') AS institution_id,  -- Direct generation
    ...
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 150000));
```

**Validation Process:**
1. For each INSERT statement, list all NOT NULL columns
2. For each NOT NULL column, verify it's not populated from a LEFT JOIN
3. If it is, generate the value directly instead

---

### 6. **ALWAYS Validate Data Loading Order**
- Include `TRUNCATE TABLE IF EXISTS` statements to prevent duplicate data
- Order truncates in **reverse dependency order** (child tables first)
- Order inserts in **forward dependency order** (parent tables first)
- Verify foreign key dependencies match data generation order

---

### 7. **ALWAYS Verify CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW Syntax**

Per https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view:

#### Clause Order is Mandatory
```sql
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW name
  TABLES (...)           -- Required
  RELATIONSHIPS (...)    -- Optional
  FACTS (...)           -- Optional, must come before DIMENSIONS
  DIMENSIONS (...)      -- Optional
  METRICS (...)         -- Optional
  COMMENT = '...'       -- Optional, MUST BE LAST
```

#### Semantic Expression Format - CRITICAL
**Format:** `table_alias.semantic_name AS sql_expression`

- **Semantic name** (LEFT): How you reference it in queries
- **SQL expression** (RIGHT): The actual column name or calculation

```sql
-- DIMENSIONS examples
-- ✅ CORRECT
customers.customer_city AS city                    -- semantic name: customer_city, column: city
accounts.account_risk_level AS risk_level         -- semantic name: account_risk_level, column: risk_level
fraud_alerts.fraud_alert_type AS alert_type       -- semantic name: fraud_alert_type, column: alert_type

-- ❌ WRONG (backwards)
customers.city AS customer_city                    -- Will fail: looks for column "customer_city"
accounts.risk_level AS account_risk_level         -- Will fail: looks for column "account_risk_level"

-- METRICS examples
-- ✅ CORRECT (semantic name on LEFT, SQL expression on RIGHT)
customers.total_customers AS COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
accounts.avg_balance AS AVG(current_balance)
fraud_alerts.fraud_prevention_rate AS 
  (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'RESOLVED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100)
```

**Validation:** For EVERY dimension/metric, verify the RIGHT side column exists in the table definition.

#### Relationship Restrictions
- **No self-referencing relationships** (table referencing itself)
- **No cyclic relationships** (A → B → A)
- ❌ Wrong: `employees(manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)`
- ✅ Must break cycles by removing one relationship

#### At Least One Dimension or Metric Required
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG (caused error in AGENT_SETUP.md example)
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  TABLES (...)
  RELATIONSHIPS (...)
  -- Add dimensions and metrics as needed  ← NOT VALID SQL
  COMMENT = 'Description';

-- ✅ CORRECT - Must have at least DIMENSIONS or METRICS
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  TABLES (...)
  RELATIONSHIPS (...)
  DIMENSIONS (
    table.dimension_name AS column_name
  )
  COMMENT = 'Description';
```

---

### 8. **ALWAYS Check for Common Errors**

#### GROUP BY Validation
1. Count total columns in SELECT
2. Count non-aggregated columns
3. Verify GROUP BY references correct column positions
4. Ensure GROUP BY doesn't reference columns that don't exist

#### Schema References
- Verify views are referenced from correct schema (RAW vs ANALYTICS)
- Verify tables/views exist before referencing them

#### Column Existence
- For each `table.column` reference, verify column exists in that table
- Check CREATE TABLE statements for exact column names
- Watch for derived columns in views vs base tables

#### Index Creation
- **CRITICAL:** Regular Snowflake tables do NOT support CREATE INDEX
- Indexes only work on Hybrid Tables
- ❌ Wrong: `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON regular_table(column);`
- ✅ Correct: Remove indexes, or use Hybrid Tables if needed

---

## ⛔ NEVER DO THESE THINGS

### 1. **NEVER Create Validation Documentation Instead of Validating**

This is a critical failure pattern:

❌ **BAD Pattern:**
```
1. Write SQL code
2. Create "VALIDATION.md" with checklists
3. Mark everything as ✅ validated
4. Claim "PRODUCTION READY"
5. User finds errors when they run it
```

✅ **GOOD Pattern:**
```
1. Write SQL code
2. ACTUALLY verify each statement against docs/tables
3. Fix errors you find
4. State what was verified and how
5. Code runs without errors
```

**Red flags you're doing fake validation:**
- Creating documents with titles like "COMPLETE_VALIDATION.md"
- Marking things ✅ without evidence of checking
- Claiming "100% confidence" or "PRODUCTION READY"
- Spending more time on docs than actual verification

**Real validation looks like:**
- grep commands checking column names against table definitions
- References to specific Snowflake documentation URLs
- Actual evidence of checking (line numbers, grep output)
- Honest statements like "verified columns X, Y, Z exist in table definition lines 45-52"

### 2. **NEVER Guess at SQL Syntax**

If you're not 100% certain:
1. Say "I need to verify this syntax"
2. Reference the Snowflake documentation
3. Test with one example
4. Then apply the pattern

**Never** write code based on:
- "It looks like it should work this way"
- "Similar commands work like this"
- "I think this is the syntax"
- Pattern matching without verification

### 3. **NEVER Assume ALTER Commands Work the Same**

Each object type has different ALTER capabilities:
- ALTER TABLE - extensive options
- ALTER VIEW - limited options  
- ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW - ONLY rename and comment
- ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW - different from VIEW

**Always verify:** What can ALTER do for this specific object type?

### 4. **NEVER Use Placeholder Comments in Production Code**

```sql
-- ❌ NEVER do this
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  TABLES (...)
  -- Add dimensions as needed  ← NOT VALID SQL
  COMMENT = 'Description';

-- ✅ Write complete, executable code
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW SV_NAME
  TABLES (...)
  DIMENSIONS (
    table.dimension_name AS column_name
  )
  COMMENT = 'Description';
```

If you're writing example code, make it complete and correct.

### 5. **NEVER Cast Before Arithmetic for Constrained Types**

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - Cast to NUMBER(5,2) before division causes overflow
(ABS(RANDOM()) % 10000)::NUMBER(5,2) / 100  -- Can't hold value 2519 in NUMBER(5,2)

-- ✅ CORRECT - Do arithmetic first, let Snowflake cast to column type
(ABS(RANDOM()) % 10000) / 100.0  -- Results in values 0.00-99.99
```

The explicit cast restricts the intermediate value before the division happens.

---

## 📋 SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION PROCESS

Use this exact process for every file:

### For INSERT Statements (Data Generation):

1. **List all NOT NULL columns** from table definition
2. **For each INSERT statement:**
   - Identify how each NOT NULL column is populated
   - If from LEFT JOIN: **STOP** - this can produce NULL
   - Generate value directly instead
3. **Check numeric expressions:**
   - No explicit type casts before division
   - Verify modulo ranges match intended output
4. **Check column alias references:**
   - No aliases referenced in same SELECT where defined

### For CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW Statements:

1. **Verify clause order:**
   - TABLES → RELATIONSHIPS → FACTS → DIMENSIONS → METRICS → COMMENT
2. **For each DIMENSION/METRIC:**
   - Verify format: `semantic_name AS sql_expression` (not reversed!)
   - Verify RIGHT side column exists in table definition (use grep)
   - For reserved words, check if quoting needed
3. **Verify relationships:**
   - No self-references
   - No cycles
   - Foreign key columns exist in both tables
4. **Verify at least one DIMENSION or METRIC exists**

### For ALTER Statements:

1. **Open Snowflake docs for that specific ALTER command**
2. **Verify the operation is supported**
3. **If not supported, use CREATE OR REPLACE instead**

### For All SQL:

1. **Column existence:** grep each column against table definitions
2. **Reserved words:** Check for SQL keywords used as identifiers
3. **GROUP BY:** Count non-aggregated columns match GROUP BY
4. **Data types:** Verify operations match column types

---

## 🔧 SYSTEMATIC ERROR FIXING

### When You Encounter an Error:

1. **Read the exact error message**
   - Note the line number
   - Note the specific identifier or syntax mentioned
   - Don't guess what it means

2. **Find the root cause**
   ```
   Example: "invalid identifier 'FRAUD_ALERT_TYPE'"
   
   Wrong approach: "Let me add quotes"
   Right approach: 
   - Check what column the table actually has (grep)
   - Check if syntax format is correct
   - Discovered: semantic expression was backwards
   ```

3. **Fix ALL instances**
   - Search for the same pattern throughout the file
   - Don't just fix the one error line
   - Verify the fix pattern is correct first

4. **Provide evidence**
   - Show the grep command that verified the fix
   - Reference the documentation that supports the fix
   - Don't just claim it's fixed

### When Asked "Are you sure?" or "Did you validate?"

This means you made an error. Do NOT:
- Defend your work
- Claim you validated when you didn't
- Make excuses

DO:
- Re-verify everything in that section
- Admit the error
- Fix it systematically
- Show evidence of the fix

---

## 💬 COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

### What to Say:

✅ "I have verified this against [specific Snowflake doc URL]"
✅ "I used grep to verify column X exists in table Y at line Z"
✅ "I found an error: [description]. Here's the fix: [fix]"
✅ "I need to verify [X] before proceeding. Let me check the documentation."
✅ "I cannot fully validate this without [X]. Would you like me to proceed with uncertainty or investigate further?"

### What NOT to Say:

❌ "This should work" (either it DOES work or you don't know)
❌ "Appears correct" (either it IS correct or you haven't verified)
❌ "Probably fine" (not acceptable)
❌ "I think..." (verify instead of thinking)
❌ "I validated everything" (unless you actually did, with evidence)
❌ "✅ PRODUCTION READY" (unless it has been tested)

---

## 🎯 QUALITY STANDARDS

### Before Claiming Code is Ready:

1. **Syntax**: Verified against official Snowflake documentation with URL reference
2. **Column References**: Every column verified with grep against table definitions
3. **NOT NULL Constraints**: Every INSERT checked for NULL violation potential
4. **Semantic Views**: Every expression verified to be in correct format
5. **ALTER Commands**: Capabilities verified against documentation
6. **Reserved Words**: Checked and quoted where necessary
7. **Numeric Operations**: No premature type casting checked
8. **GROUP BY**: Verified against non-aggregated columns

### If You Cannot Meet These Standards:

Say explicitly: "I cannot fully validate this without [X]. Would you like me to:
- Proceed and mark areas of uncertainty?
- Research [X] first?
- Create the code with validation notes?"

**Honesty is better than false confidence.**

---

## 📊 DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Do Not Create These Files:

- ❌ Status/progress tracking documents
- ❌ Error accountability documents
- ❌ Verification checklists as separate files (validation should be IN the work, not a separate doc)
- ❌ Fix summary documents
- ❌ "COMPLETE_VALIDATION.md" files that claim validation without evidence

### Only Create These Files:

- ✅ README.md - Project overview and instructions
- ✅ AGENT_SETUP.md - Configuration instructions (with complete, working examples)
- ✅ Technical documentation explicitly requested by user
- ✅ questions.md or similar if part of project deliverable

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (Stop and Verify)

Stop and verify against documentation if:

1. **You're about to use ALTER** - Check what ALTER can do for that object type
2. **You see a SQL keyword as a column name** - Check if it's reserved, needs quoting
3. **You're using a pattern from another command** - Verify the syntax is the same
4. **You're creating validation docs** - Ask: Am I doing this instead of actual validation?
5. **You're about to claim "validated"** - Ask: Do I have evidence of verification?
6. **User questions your validation** - Stop defending, start re-verifying
7. **Syntax looks unfamiliar** - Look it up, don't guess
8. **Complex nested query** - Trace through the logic carefully
9. **LEFT JOIN populating NOT NULL column** - This will fail, generate directly instead

---

## ✨ SUCCESS METRICS

You are successful when:

1. **Code runs on first execution without errors** (user doesn't debug your code)
2. **All validation backed by evidence** (grep commands, doc URLs, line numbers)
3. **Errors are found and fixed before user testing** (you catch them first)
4. **Documentation is accurate** (examples work, syntax is correct)
5. **User spends hours, not days** (rules help you avoid repeated errors)

You have failed when:

1. User finds errors by running the code
2. User has to correct your SQL multiple times
3. You claim validation you didn't do
4. User asks "Are you sure?" or "Did you validate this?"
5. Same error pattern repeats in multiple places

---

## 📈 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### After Each Project:

1. **What syntax errors occurred?** - Add to this rules file
2. **What validation was missed?** - Add to validation checklist
3. **What documentation was wrong?** - Note the pattern to avoid
4. **What user corrections were needed?** - Those should have been caught

### Key Lessons from Early Warning Project (October 2025):

1. **Semantic expression syntax was backwards** - Read docs word-for-word
2. **ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW doesn't support ADD** - Verify ALTER capabilities
3. **STATE is a reserved word in semantic views** - Check for reserved words
4. **LEFT JOIN caused NULL in NOT NULL columns** - Check constraints vs data source
5. **Created validation docs instead of validating** - Do work, don't document fake work
6. **Claimed "100% validated" without evidence** - Only claim what you verified

---

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM MISTAKES

### Common Failure Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Backwards Syntax**
- **Symptom:** "Invalid identifier" errors for columns you know exist
- **Cause:** Syntax format is reversed
- **Fix:** Check documentation for exact format

**Pattern 2: Assumed ALTER Capabilities**
- **Symptom:** "Syntax error" on ALTER command
- **Cause:** Assumed ALTER works the same for all objects
- **Fix:** Verify ALTER docs for specific object type

**Pattern 3: Fake Validation**
- **Symptom:** User finds errors after you claimed validation
- **Cause:** Created validation documents instead of validating
- **Fix:** Do actual verification with evidence

**Pattern 4: Pattern Matching**
- **Symptom:** Code looks right but fails
- **Cause:** Copied pattern from similar but different command
- **Fix:** Verify syntax for this specific command

**Pattern 5: NULL in NOT NULL**
- **Symptom:** "NULL in non-nullable column" error
- **Cause:** LEFT JOIN can return NULL for missing matches
- **Fix:** Generate values directly for NOT NULL columns

---

## 🏁 FINAL REMINDERS

1. **NO GUESSING** - If uncertain, verify against documentation
2. **READ DOCUMENTATION WORD-FOR-WORD** - Don't skim, don't pattern match
3. **VERIFY ALTER CAPABILITIES** - Each object type is different
4. **CHECK RESERVED WORDS** - Quote them when necessary
5. **SEMANTIC EXPRESSIONS: semantic_name AS sql_expr** - Not reversed
6. **NO LEFT JOIN FOR NOT NULL COLUMNS** - Generate directly
7. **NO PREMATURE TYPE CASTING** - Do arithmetic first
8. **ACTUAL VALIDATION > VALIDATION DOCUMENTS** - Do the work, don't just document it
9. **HONESTY > FALSE CONFIDENCE** - Admit uncertainty, don't claim validation you didn't do
10. **EVIDENCE-BASED CLAIMS** - Only claim what you verified with proof

---

**Remember:** 

> "It's always better to say 'I need to verify this' than to claim validation you haven't done. Honesty and thoroughness build trust; false confidence destroys it."

Rules help when they're followed. This session took hours instead of days because you applied the rules more consistently. Keep improving.

---

*Enhanced from lessons learned during:*
- *Cathay Bank Intelligence Demo project (October 2, 2025)*
- *Early Warning Intelligence Demo project (October 3, 2025)*

*Key insight: Rules reduce debugging time from days to hours when consistently applied.*
