# Cortex Search Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully extended your Early Warning Intelligence Demo to include **Snowflake Cortex Search** for unstructured data. This addition enables semantic search over fraud investigation notes, customer support transcripts, and policy documents, powering Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for your AI agent.

---

## What Was Created

### 1. New SQL Script: `06_create_cortex_search.sql`

This comprehensive script includes:

#### Three New Tables for Unstructured Data:

1. **FRAUD_INVESTIGATION_NOTES** (50,000 records)
   - Investigation notes with realistic fraud case documentation
   - Covers: account takeover, synthetic identity, elder fraud, fraud rings, chargebacks
   - Includes: case status, tags, amounts involved, investigation dates

2. **CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_TRANSCRIPTS** (25,000 records)
   - Customer support interactions across phone, chat, email, in-person
   - Categories: fraud reports, account issues, payment issues, general inquiries
   - Includes: sentiment scores, resolution status, fraud indicators

3. **POLICY_DOCUMENTS** (5 documents)
   - Fraud Prevention and Detection Policy
   - Account Opening Risk Assessment Guidelines
   - Zelle Payment Network Security Standards
   - Paze Checkout Fraud Prevention Training
   - Synthetic Identity Fraud Detection FAQ

#### Three Cortex Search Services:

1. **FRAUD_NOTES_SEARCH**
   - Searches over 50K fraud investigation notes
   - Attributes: alert_id, customer_id, institution_id, note_type, case_status, fraud_confirmed, tags, investigation_date
   - Target lag: 1 hour (near real-time updates)

2. **SUPPORT_TRANSCRIPTS_SEARCH**
   - Searches over 25K customer support transcripts
   - Attributes: customer_id, institution_id, channel, category, resolution_status, fraud_related, support_date
   - Target lag: 1 hour

3. **POLICY_DOCUMENTS_SEARCH**
   - Searches fraud prevention policies and training materials
   - Attributes: document_type, document_category, document_title, version, is_active, effective_date
   - Target lag: 24 hours (policies update less frequently)

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Change tracking enabled on all tables (required for Cortex Search)
- ✅ Realistic, diverse content covering all major fraud scenarios
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships to structured data
- ✅ All SQL syntax verified against Snowflake documentation
- ✅ Uses default embedding model (snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5)

- Reference to Cortex Search in Project Overview
- New tables listed in RAW Schema
- New section for Cortex Search Services
- Updated file list with `06_create_cortex_search.sql`
- Updated setup instructions (now 6 SQL files)
- Added unstructured data highlights

---

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Execute the new SQL script**:
   ```sql
   -- In Snowflake, run:
   -- 06_create_cortex_search.sql
   -- Execution time: 3-5 minutes
   ```

2. **Verify services are created**:
   ```sql
   SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SCHEMA RAW;
   ```

3. **Test with sample searches**:
   ```sql
   -- Search fraud investigation notes
   SELECT * 
   FROM TABLE(
       SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
           'EARLY_WARNING_DEMO.RAW.FRAUD_NOTES_SEARCH',
           'account takeover phishing'
       )
   ) 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Integrate with your agent**:
   - Update agent system prompt (see AGENT_SETUP.md Section 5.5)
   - Or create the stored procedure for unified search
   - Or create views combining structured and unstructured data

5. **Test agent with new questions**:
   - "Find similar account takeover cases from the last 6 months"
   - "What does our policy say about handling Zelle payment disputes?"
   - "Show me customer support cases involving elder fraud scams"

## Key Technical Details

### Syntax Verification

All SQL syntax has been verified against official Snowflake documentation:
- **CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE**: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search
- **Cortex Search Overview**: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview

### Query Function

Cortex Search uses the `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW()` function:

```sql
SELECT result.* 
FROM TABLE(
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
        '<service_name>',
        '<search_query>'
    )
) AS result
WHERE result.<attribute> = '<filter_value>'
LIMIT <num_results>;
```

### Embedding Model

By default, uses `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`:
- Balanced performance and accuracy
- No additional cost vs. other models in same tier
- Can be changed to larger model (`snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0`) for better accuracy

### Cost Considerations

1. **Warehouse Usage**: Services use EARLY_WARNING_WH for indexing
2. **Target Lag**: Longer lag = less frequent refreshes = lower cost
3. **Storage**: Indexes stored separately from source tables
4. **Search Queries**: Charged per query execution

Refer to Snowflake Service Consumption Table for exact credit costs.

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. RAG for Fraud Analysis
Agent can retrieve context from past investigations to:
- Identify similar fraud patterns
- Recommend investigation procedures
- Estimate potential losses
- Suggest prevention measures

### 2. Policy Q&A
Agent can answer policy questions by searching:
- Fraud prevention policies
- Risk assessment guidelines
- Procedure documents
- Training materials

### 3. Customer Support Insights
Agent can find similar support cases to:
- Recommend resolution approaches
- Identify recurring issues
- Analyze sentiment trends
- Track fraud-related complaints

### 4. Fraud Pattern Discovery
Semantic search enables finding related cases even when:
- Different terminology is used
- Cases don't share exact keywords
- Patterns are described differently

## Advantages Over Traditional Search

| Feature | Traditional Keyword Search | Cortex Search (Semantic) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Search Type** | Exact text matches | Meaning-based matches |
| **Synonyms** | Must list all synonyms | Understands automatically |
| **Context** | Limited | Full semantic understanding |
| **Typos** | Often fails | More forgiving |
| **Phrases** | Must match exactly | Understands intent |
| **Maintenance** | High (update keywords) | Low (automatic) |
| **RAG Ready** | No | Yes (built for LLMs) |
